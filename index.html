		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			In our previous study, we have done a lot of detailed analysis of basic operations for the red-black tree based on the traditional sequential algorithm. In this project, I am going to apply parallel algorithm to implement red-black tree's operations, <i>search</i> and <i>insertion</i>. And I will compare the performance of search and insertion operations for lock-based and lock-free synchronization. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The red-black tree is a balanced binary search tree with height O(log <i>n</i>), and efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, which makes it a better choice than regular binary search in search-intensive applications. And it only requires few rotations to rebalance the tree and keep it red-black properties.
		</p>
		<p>
			As we known, it takes O(log <i>n</i>) for red-black tree's search and insertion operations by sequential algorithms. As for using parallel algorithms, the search and insertion time would be O(log <i>n</i> + log<i>k</i>), where <i>k</i> is the number threads/concurrents. Although they both have the upper bound O(log <i>n</i>), and parallel algorithm even have another add-on term <i>log k</i>, parallel algorithms would provide a smaller coefficient for the big-O notation. And in my project, I will compare the performance on lock-based and lock-free parallel algorithms, and I will claim that lock-free synchronization has a better performance than lock-based.

		<h2>Parallel Algorithm</h2>
		<p>
			<i>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_algorithm">parallel algorithm</a>, as opposed to a traditional sequential algorithm, is an algorithm which can be executed a piece at a time on many different processing devices, and then combined together again at the end to get the correct result.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			People usually build cost-effective parallel algorithms by defining multiple operations on each step to improve the performance of traditional sequential algorithm, which specifies a sequence of operations and each step does one operation.
		</p>
		<h3>Lock-Based Algorithm</h3>
		<p>
			<i>A lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many threads of execution.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			Lock-based parallel algorithms are usually implemented on the parallel random-access machine (PRAM), which is a shared-memory model of parallel computation that consists of a collection of identical processors and a shared memory. There are four types of PRAM.
			<ul>
  				<li><b>EREW (exclusive read exclusive write)</b></li>
  				Concurrents are not allowed to read and write to the same memory location at the same time.
  				<li><b>CREW (concurrent read exclusive write)</b></li>
  				Concurrents can only read a memory location.
  				<li><b>CRCW (concurrent read concurrent write)</b></li>
  				Concurrents allows both concurrent reads and concurrent writes to a memory location
  				<li><b>ERCW (Exclusive read concurrent write)</b></li>
  				This case is usually not considered.
			</ul>

		<h3>Lock-Free Algorithm</h3>
		<p>
			Opposite to lock-based algorithms, lock-free algorithms are used to implement concurrents' operations without using "lock" or "mutex".

		<h4>CAS (Compare and Swap)</h4>
		<p>
			The lock-free strategy I am going to use in this project is called <b><i>CAS (Compare and Swap)</i></b>.<br />
			"Rather than acquiring a lock, a process makes a copy of the data it wishes to modify, changes the copy and then replaces the original data with the copy only if the original data is unchanged. If there is no contention, the update is made with no appreciable overhead. If there is contention, all but one concurrent process accessing the shared data must “roll-back” and redo its computation using the updated data." Most modern programming languages support <i>CAS</i> as an atomic operation. For example, in this project, I am going to use JAVA's <i>AtomicBoolean</i> class to realize the CAS strategy.
			The following piece of pesudocode just demonstrates how CAS function works.
			<pre>
CAS(shVble,savedValue,newValue)
Begin Atomic
if (shVble==savedValue) {
    shVble=newValue;
    return True;
} else {
    return False; 
}
End Atomic

do  {
    savedValue=shVble;
    newValue=computeNewValue(savedValue);
}while (!CAS(shVble,savedValue,newValue));

		<h3>Operations</h3>
		<p>
			For this project purpose, I just focus on <i>search</i> and <i>insertion</i> operations on red-black tree.
		</p>
		<h4>Search</h4>
		<p>
			Just like any regular binary search tree, we use recursion on search operation. 
		</p>
		<div class"row">
			<h4>Insertion</h4>
			<p>
				Before working on the details of the <i>insertion</i> operation, we need to introduction an important helper operation, <i><b>rotation</i></b> for red-black tree.

			<table class="table">

			<p>
				When we insert a new node to the red-black tree, the first step is physically insert the node to tree as we do for regular binary search tree, and color the node to red. Then we need to fix the tree's red-black properties from the inserted node up to the root. Suppose we insert node <i><b>N</b></i> to the red-black tree. There are three cases for the fix-up operation:
				<table class="table" id="case-table">
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>
								Case 1: The uncle of inserted node is <font color="red">red</font>.
							</th>
							<th>
								Case 2: The inserted node is right child of its parent and its uncle is black.
							</th>
							<th>
								Case 3: The inserted node is left child of its parent and its uncle is black.
							</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>

						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								For case 1, we just need to recolor the inserted node, its parent, uncle and its grandparent.
							</td>
							<td>
								We can to a left rotation on the inserted node's parent to turn it to case 3. And switch label for the parent and inserted node.
							</td>
							<td>
								In case 3, we first do a right rotation on the inserted node's parent, then recolor parent and grandparent.

		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p>
			I programmed in JAVA for this project. I use JAVA's "<i>Thread</i> to simulate concurrents' operations. And use "<i>ReentrantLock</i>" lock class to implement EREW lock- based synchronization. For lock-free CAS operation, I use "<i>AtomicBoolean</i>" class which provides the convenience for doing the CAS atomic operation. My lock-free implementation is based on the idea of Ma's Algorithm and pseudocode provided in Kim's paper. Finally, I modify the code of treeGUI from Github to provide a small JFrame visualization to display the red-black tree built by my algorithm. As the code limits, the visualization only works and layouts fine for small data set, for example 20-node trees.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<h3>Ma's Algorithm</h3>
		<p>
			Ma's algorithm is built upon the basic sequential insertion algorithm with the addition of a "local area" concept and the use of lock-free primitives to control concurrency. And Ma also adds an extra <i>flag</i> field to each node to indicate whether a process gains control of the node, which is used for CAS operation check.
		</P>
		<h4>Local Area</h4>
		<p>
			<img src="img/local_area.png" alt="local area" width="45%" height="200" align="right">
			The local area consists of the set of nodes that a process must have full control of
			to ensure successful completion of an operation. As we see, the local area for insertion is just made of nodes involved in the rotation fix-up operation. With the local area concept, if several processes in a localized region have overlapping areas, only the one process that obtains all the flags in its local area will be able to proceed. Other processes will have to re-attempt to gain control of their local areas. As one insertion process completes its processing in one part of the tree, it may either finish entirely (and release all its flags) or move up the tree. In the latter case, the process first obtains the flags of nodes in its new local area, moves up, and then releases the flags that it set for the nodes in its old local area. Releasing flags allows other processes that may have been waiting to advance.

			<img src="img/insertion_pseudo.png" alt="insertion" width="45%" height="550" align="right">
			With the idea of Ma's Algorithm, I add the <i>flag</i> field to my "LockFreeRBNode" object. And the code for <i>CAS</i> and <i>SetupLocalAreaForInsert</i> functions to the regular sequential insertion operation. Here the pseudocode for changes in <i>insertion</i> function.

		<h2>Experiment Results</h2>
		<h3>Sample Output for visualization</h3>
		I modified the TreeGUI.java code from Github to visualize red-black trees I got from my experiment. Due to the visualization code limits, it can only layout and display well small trees. In my project, I applied the code to display trees with less than 20 nodes. I generated 20 random nodes from 0 to 1000. And I ran lock-based algorithm and lock-free algorithm on the same dataset. As we known, different insertion order could result in different red-black trees. Here are one sample output from my experiment. You can click to enlarge the figures. On the left of the figure, it demonstrates the red-black tree built by the concurrents flow shown on the right.<br />

		<br />
		Then I did experiments for testing the performance, I ran my program 10 times, and took the average time as the result. 
		<h3>Insert 1000 nodes to an empty red-black tree</h3>
		In this experiment I totally insert 1000 random nodes to an empty red-black tree by using different number of threads. For example, when the number of threads is 10, it means each thread inserts 100 nodes to the tree.<br /> 
		<img src="img/insertion_nodes_pic.png" alt="insertion node" width="50%" height="300" align="middle">

		<h3>Use 4 threads to insert different number of nodes</h3>

		<h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
		<p>
			According to my implementation and experiment results, we can reach the conclusion that lock-free algorithms have a better performance on <i>search</i> and <i>insertion</i> operations on relatively large red-black tree. When the tree gets larger, the performance difference would be more obvious. For future work, we can work on implementing lock-free algorithm for <i>deletion</i> operation. Since red-black trees store information not only on leaf nodes but also internal nodes, <i>deletion</i> on red-black trees would result in a more complex structural change, which makes the implementation much harder. Another thing we can do in the future is to find a way to visualize the process for lock-free insertion, which could give users a more straightforward demonstration on how these concurrents work. In addition, in Kim's paper, he proposed an improved version on Ma's algorithm, which needs fewer CAS operations by defining a larger "local area." We might try out his method, and compare the performance with the original Ma's algorithm. We can also study the better concurrent control method "wait-free" to improve the performance for lock-free synchronization.
